    <h1>Introduction to Data Structures</h1>
    
    <p>Data structures are a way of organizing and storing data in computers in such a way that we can perform operations on the data more efficiently. Data structures are used in almost every program or software system.</p>
    
    <h2>Common Data Structures</h2>
    
    <p>Here are some common data structures used in computer science:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Arrays</li>
        <li>Linked Lists</li>
        <li>Stacks</li>
        <li>Queues</li>
        <li>Trees</li>
        <li>Graphs</li>
        <li>Hash Tables</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Binary Search Tree</h2>
    
    <p>A binary search tree is a binary tree where each node has at most two children, and for each node, all elements in its left subtree are less than the node, and all elements in its right subtree are greater than the node.</p>
    
    <pre><code>
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

class BinarySearchTree:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = None
    
    def insert(self, value):
        # Implementation details
        pass
    </code></pre>
    
    <p>Binary search trees provide efficient data storage with fast lookup, addition, and removal operations.</p>
